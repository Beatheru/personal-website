## Personal website

This is my personal website built by me to introduce myself and display some of my skills and projects.

It is hosted myself on [http://beath.dev](http://beath.dev)

Alternatively, it is also hosted on Vercel at [http://beath.vercel.app](http://beath.vercel.app)

## Tools

These are the tools/libraries I used to create the website:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - A fullstack server side rendered version of React
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS library that provides classes for common CSS
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) - An open-sourced and fully accessible component library built using RadixUI (headless accessible components) and TailwindCSS
- [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com) - An open-sourced animated component library that uses Framer motion

What makes Shadcn and Aceternity unique is that they are not like typical component libraries where you install it as a dependency and then import and use the components.
They are more like tools where you install the packages they rely on and then directly copy their code into your codebase.
This makes it so that you own the code and can easily make modifications to it.
